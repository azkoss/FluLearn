Background

Since Richard Matthew Stallmanâ€™s Free Software Movement, free software and open source software have been booming. It has played
a huge role in human civilization. However, open source software is exploited by the rising To-Business companies,
especially cloud computing ones. They take more than what they give back, and even breach open source consensus, such as infringement.
Hence, some open source software teams have to take actions to stop this, e.g.

https://mariadb.com/bsl11/
https://redislabs.com/community/licenses/
https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license
https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license

However, those licenses are condemned by the community who follow the lead of OSI(Open Source Initiative) for not being approved by OSI.
Only talking about being open source but ignoring the struggling open source developers will not solve the problem for those developers.
Only under the premised of their survival, can open source software developers keep maintaining open source software. Hence, we believe that,

Any software that helps others, no matter what its size, functions, license, or open source percentage is, should be respected;
Any behavior that helps the developers, no matter what its form, participation, succession, duration, should be encouraged and appreciated.

Therefore, ZENTAO OPEN SOFTWARE LICENSE 1.0, different from open source, is drafted to seek a balance between being open and being commercial.
